# Question

What are "static assets"? How do you generate static assets in a React project?

# Answer
Static assets are files that don't change dynamically and are presented to the users browser as it is stored on the server. You generate static assets in a react project by storing these static assets in the public folder and use the src folder if you want to import them.

Great start! You answered the first question correctly! However, you described where the static files are stored but not how to generate them. In a React project, static assets are generated by running npm run build.
