# Question

What are "static assets"? How do you generate static assets in a React project?

# Answer
Static assets are files that don't change dynamically and are presented to the users browser as it is stored on the server. You generate static assets in a react project by storing these static assets in the public folder and running npm run build. Use the src folder if you want to import them.
