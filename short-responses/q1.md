# Question

What makes a middleware function different from a normal controller?

# Answer
What makes a middleweare function different from a normal controller is that it processes requests to the next function in the chain without sending it to the client. While normal controllers parses a request and sends a response to the client.

~~Not exactly, you mentioned "it processes requests and responses across an application". This is false, middleware functions main difference from controller functions are that unlike controllers, middleware pass the request to the next function in the chain without sending a response to the client. They sit in the "middle" of the chain of middleware/controllers.~~
