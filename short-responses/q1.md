What makes a middleweare function different from a normal controller is that it processes requests and responses across an application, used when data is shared across multiple routes. While controllers are components that manage specific data ,related to particular routes.

Not exactly, you mentioned "it processes requests and responses across an application". This is false, middleware functions main difference from controller functions are that unlike controllers, middleware pass the request to the next function in the chain without sending a response to the client. They sit in the "middle" of the chain of middleware/controllers.
